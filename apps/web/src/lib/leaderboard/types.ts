/**
 * Canonical types for the member Leaderboard ranking (SPEC §2 posture).
 *
 * The leaderboard ranks members on the ACT of working — showing up, keeping
 * the discipline, staying regular, doing the tracking work — NEVER on trading
 * performance / P&L. It is a HIGHER-LEVEL composite of four already-computed,
 * already-tested behavioral surfaces:
 *
 *   - assiduity   ← the `engagement` behavioral dimension (check-in fill rate,
 *                    dual-slot, streak, journal depth, meeting attendance, …)
 *   - discipline  ← the `discipline` behavioral dimension (plan respect,
 *                    routine, process completeness, intention kept, …)
 *   - regularity  ← the `ConstancyScore` regularity axis (rhythm over the
 *                    window; excused absences are NOT penalized)
 *   - work        ← the tracking-coverage gauge (breadth of self-tracking)
 *
 * 🔒 Firewall §21.5: the `consistency` dimension (expectancy / profit factor /
 * drawdown — the real-edge P&L proxy) is DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED. A member's rank
 * can never move because a trade won or lost. Enforced by
 * `test/anti-leak/leaderboard-isolation.test.ts`.
 *
 * Mirrors the `ScoreResult<Parts>` shape used by the four behavioral scores so
 * the same `aggregateDimension` renormalization and the same UI breakdown
 * ("pourquoi ce rang ?") apply unchanged.

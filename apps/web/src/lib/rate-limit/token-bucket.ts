/**
 * In-memory token bucket rate limiter (J5 audit Security HIGH H2 — TIER 4
 * follow-up).
 *
 * Single-instance V1 deployment on Hetzner — no Redis required. The bucket
 * map is bounded by an LRU cap so a flood of unique IPs can't OOM the
 * process. Wrap-around is acceptable: the worst case is that a long-quiet
 * client gets a fresh bucket on next request (lenient), never that another
 * client's bucket gets credited (strict).
 *
 * Algorithm: each bucket holds `bucketSize` tokens, refilled at
 * `refillRate` tokens/second. Each call to `consume(key)` removes 1 token
 * if available; otherwise rejects with a `retryAfterMs` hint.
 *
 * Migration path to Redis (J10 prod): swap `Map` for an Upstash redis
 * pipeline + Lua script that atomically refills + decrements. The
 * `consume()` signature stays identical so route handlers don't change.
